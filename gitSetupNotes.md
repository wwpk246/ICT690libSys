In order to create a new repository head to +, then new repo

**Once in this repo**:

- select 'add file' > then 'new file'.
- the link to the main repo page is [main repo](https://github.com/wwpk246/ICT690libSys).
- the link to the markdown cheat sheet is [markdown quick ref](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).
- Next I use a blockquote to **not** quote Benjamin
  Franklin, who it is often attributed to, but to probably
  quote Xun Kuang, a [fourth century Confucian
  philosopher](https://www.fi.edu/benjamin-franklin/7-things-benjamin-franklin-never-said):

> Tell me and I forget. Teach me and I remember. Involve me
> and I learn. --Not Benjamin Franklin and probably Xun
> Kuang

~~I liked the quote so I left it in.  Thought it would be a nice reminder of the example of how certain things work.~~

And finally, a code block starts with three backticks on
their own line, followed by the code (or any kind of
pre-formatted text), followed by three closing backticks on
a their own line.

1. This is the **FIRST** time I've used the markdown language directly 
via the information from the reference sheet.
I usually use a text editor such as Sublime for most of the markup I need to perform.
