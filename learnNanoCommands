I'm not crazy about the nano controls coming from other text editors like sublime.  I'm much more familiar with the likes of android studio and visual studio code suites.  
The Json formatting and javascript flows much nicer I think.  
I much prefer to have editors be in plain black/white or have the myriad of colors to describe the variables and commands appropriately.
Overall I'm not super comfy with it yet but that's probably due to my over reliance on the nicer GUI editors with premapped commands.
